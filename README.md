Final Fantasy 7 Mod for Minecraft
=================================

This mod is designed to add various elements from Final Fantasy 7 into Minecraft.

Currently planned are:
  > Weapons,
  > Armour,
  > Items and World Gen,
  > Materia (minor magic system),
  > New Creatures and Bosses.

This is a WIP mod, that will not be released until most/all of the mod is complete and as many bugs are removed as possible.


Working in collaboration is a member of the Blushell Gaming Community, DarkEspeon.

As much of the elements of the original game will be included, but as this is my first mod, the development will be slow, but I aim for good/high quality.
