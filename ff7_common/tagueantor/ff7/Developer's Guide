Final Fantasy 7 Mod Developer's Guide:

This file will be used to explain the various stages taken place.

As there are a couple of developers for this mod project, I hope that ALL developers will contribute to this document.

Each segment will be signed by the developer working on that area.
	Example:
		> Tagueantor creates base packages.
			After writing about that stage, a SIGNED: ______ line appears. The Developer's Minecraft name will replace the "_____" section.
	It allows due credit to the respective developer, while allowing all developers to know what has been done since their last commit.
