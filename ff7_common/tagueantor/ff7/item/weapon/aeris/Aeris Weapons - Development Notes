Final Fantasy 7 Weapons - Aeris.

NOTE: Some localisations rename Aeris to Aerith. For simplicity's sake, all file tied to this this person will be declared as Aeris.

Development Notes:
	> Aeris tends to wield staves/poles in the original game.
	> An umbrella is included as her "special" weapon.
		> Will be recoded to utilise weapon damage, yet right clicking results in changing the weather to clear.
	> Not many weapons as she was killed off by Sephiroth within the first 3rd of the game.
	> For sake of ease, Aeris weapons are scaled to the same scale as the other weapons, meaning her ultimate weapon is on par to the others.
