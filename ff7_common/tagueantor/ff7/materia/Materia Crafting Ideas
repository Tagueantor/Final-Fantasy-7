FF7 Materia Crafting Ideas.

Initial ideas for crafting the majority of materia:
	> Find "elemental ores" and mine them to get elemental Crystals (of particular elements).
	> Create a "Mako block" (to represent the mako reactors which create materia).
	> Surround the Mako block with the correct combination of the elemental crystals.
		> Make a tier 1 version.
	> Crafting the higher tiers require multiple of the previous tier combined togther with another Mako block.
		> The cost for the higher tier is exponationally higher each time.
